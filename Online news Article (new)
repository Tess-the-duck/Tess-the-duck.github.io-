          <h2> A successful event! <h2/>
            <br/>
          <p>The International School of Port-Of-Spain held their annual <i>parade of flags<i/> on Thursday 9th November. This annual event shows the many nationalities of children attending the school through an hour-long parade and represents peace and unity between countries. This year, 53 countries were accounted for. All flag bearers held their flags high as they marched, adorned in their traditional costumes.  The event was well-attended. With many executives such as Her Excellency Harriot Cross, the high commissioner of the UK and Mrs Rowly, the attorney in law.

          <p>The theme for this event was "equal education" and all speakers were asked to create a speech about how education should be a human write, regardless of race, gender or differently abled. Some of the speakers were: Mrs Donoven, Miss Harriot Cross, Mrs Arif Kishani and Mrs Rowley. As stated by Mrs Rowley, the president's wife and attorney-in-law: <p/>
            <blockquote> All schools should grant the opportunity of education to those less fortunate than us. <blockqote/>
            <br/>
          <p>The event was summed up with a live music performance by the grade 9 and 10 music class who played <i>"Build a Dream"<i/>- a song which talks about achieving one's dreams and goals and <i>"waka waka"<i/> which means "to do." After the songs were played, pictures were taken with the special attendants and then an after-party was held in the library. To sum up, all that has been stated, the event was a success and the hours of work students put into it paid off.<p/>
